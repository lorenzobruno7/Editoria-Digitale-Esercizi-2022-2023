  I'm writing an example xhtml document to get converted into markdown!
  ## Examples
  
  ## Text formatting
  Sometimes with longer paragraphs
we just want a new line immediately.
  Divs are block elements too, and people don't always put their text in p tags.
  
  ## Quotey things
  
This is some documentation that should be block quoted.
  It has some indentation.
And another sentence.
